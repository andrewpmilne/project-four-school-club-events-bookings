# Testing

## Introduction

Unit tests were used across all apps in this project to automatically verify that individual components worked as expected.  
Manual testing was also employed throughout the development process to catch issues that automated tests might have missed. This included testing by the developer as well as involving third-party testers to ensure the app behaved correctly in real-world scenarios.  

Testing was performed iteratively throughout development to maintain reliability and functionality. The Agile Iterations were then adapted accordingly. Various testing environments were used, including the local development setup and staging environments.

In addition, online linter tools were employed to review code quality, enforce coding standards, and catch potential syntax or stylistic issues before deployment.



## Unit Tests

All four apps were subjected to automated testing using Python to verify that core functionality worked as intended.  
Forms were tested independently to ensure proper operation and to validate that all input constraints and error handling behaved correctly.  

See the screenshot below for examples of the test results:

### JavaScript Testing
Node.js was used as the runtime environment to execute the JavaScript tests. By leveraging Node, the project was able to run automated tests on the frontend code. The test results can be seen in the below screenshot:

## Manual Testing
Manual testing was performed throughout development to complement the automated unit tests. Each feature of the application was actively used and checked to confirm it behaved correctly. See the below tables for more info.
